Alabaster Color Scheme
===

That is my little customized version of the [alabaster theme](https://github.com/p00f/alabaster.nvim).

I just made some things bold, and changed colors for some other things.
I don't use light theme, so idk how it looks like, and I'm not gonna to fix light theme, if there will appear an issue.
